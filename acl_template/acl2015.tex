\begin{abstract}
  In the paper {\em Low-Complexity Probing via Finding Subnetworks} (Cao et al., 2021), they proposed a pruning-based probing approach, as a way of learning the sub-network of a pre-trained bert model to do a specific langusge task. \\ We reproducing the experiment of the original paper, \\ applying pruning-based probing to different model with bases and different specified tasks
  
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Probing is a way of glimpsing how a model captures some specific linguistic information \cite{Tenney}.\\
Before, the probing method is either linear or MLP, but hard to make the trade off between the probe being representative and the ability of the probe learning the data independently  \\
In {\em Low-Complexity Probing via Finding Subnetworks}, Cao et al. proposed the pruning-based probing method which\\
Improvement in both performance and complexity \\
By applying to different models, \\
In section 2, we will talk about \\
In section 3, we will present the experiments we have done to \\
In section 4, we will compare experiment outcomes and give conclusion \\
